# Loan-Default-Risk-Portfolio-Analysis
end to end analytics solution that predicts loan default risks and analyses customer retention trends with the aim of providing actionable insights to financial institutions to minimize risk, improve retention, and enhance decision making through data driven strategies.
This project highlights key Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analysis processes:

Data Processing & Structuring

Raw loan and customer datasets were cleaned, standardized, and structured for analysis.

Missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies were handled to ensure data quality, a core BI practice.

Feature Engineering & Modelling

New features such as risk bands, age groups, debt-to-income ratios, and product penetration were created to enhance insights.

Predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) were applied to estimate default probabilities, demonstrating the analytics and modeling component of BI.
Visualization & Dashboarding

Visualizations (pie charts, line charts, bubble charts, tables, and bar charts) were designed to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.

Interactive filters and scorecards allow dynamic exploration, aligning with BI objectives of actionable, data-driven decision-making.

Insight Generation & Business Impact

The dashboard provides high-level KPIs (expected loss, default probability) and detailed borrower-level insights.

Organizations can leverage these insights to mitigate risks, adjust product strategies, and optimize lending portfolios, reflecting the strategic value of BI in real-world business contexts
End-to-End Workflow

The combination of data cleaning, wrangling, modeling, and dashboarding demonstrates a full BI lifecycleâ€”from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights.

This structured approach mirrors real-world BI and Data Analytics projects, where data-driven decision-making is paramount.
